# Lecture 10: Communicating the Requirements - Insights from Industry

## 1. Introduction
This lecture provides insights from an industrial practice survey, exploring how companies implement the role of requirements engineering (RE) and the challenges they face.

## 2. Importance of Requirements Engineering (RE)
- Requirements engineering is critical for the success of software development projects.
- Lack of proper RE is a core contributing factor to the failure of many projects.
  
The role of the requirements engineer, as defined by IREB, is to collaborate with stakeholders to elicit, document, validate, and manage requirements.

## 3. Industrial Survey Insights
The survey by Franch, Palomares & Gorschek (CACM 6/21) involved interviewing 24 IT professionals across 12 companies, focusing on the role of requirements engineering in various projects.

### Key Questions:
1. **Does the role of "requirements engineer" exist in your company?**
   - Most organizations confirm the existence of the RE role, especially in Agile projects.
   
2. **Is the role of RE a designated position or a flexible responsibility?**
   - In some companies, the role is assigned to a specific person (e.g., business analyst).
   - In others, it is a responsibility taken on by someone like the system architect or developer on a case-by-case basis.

3. **What are the main responsibilities of the RE role?**
   - Elicitation, negotiation, documentation, validation, and change management.
   - Additional responsibilities may include ROI determination, project management, and test-related activities.

## 4. Communication Risks in RE
Several communication risks were highlighted by the respondents:
- **Missing Requirements**: Incompleteness in requirements is a common issue.
- **Ambiguity**: Misunderstandings often arise due to unclear communication between roles.
- **Specification Quality**: Testers often found that the level of detail in requirements was insufficient for them to fully understand the system.

These risks underline the need for better communication and clearer specification of requirements throughout the development process.

## 5. Summary
- Requirements engineering is a pivotal role in software development, with responsibilities that can range from elicitation to validation and change management.
- Proper communication and documentation are essential to avoid common pitfalls like missing or ambiguous requirements.
- The industrial survey provides valuable insights into how different companies handle the RE role and the challenges they face.
