# Chapter Notes: Requirements are not really about requirements

## Overview
- Requirements define what a software product, hardware product, or service is meant to do.
- Requirements exist whether discovered or not, whether documented or not.
- Focus should not be on creating a requirements document, but on solving the real problem.
- The real art of requirements discovery lies in uncovering the real problem to be solved.

## Fundamental Truths

### Truth 1: Requirements are about solving problems
- Requirements discovery is about solving a business problem.
- The real challenge is identifying the actual problem, not just writing down requirements.
- The type of business, scientific, government, or any other industry is irrelevant—the process is the same.

### Truth 2: The product must be valuable to the owner
- Focus should be on the owner who pays for the software, not just the user.
- The owner values the benefit the product provides.
- The product’s cost should be proportionate to its benefit for the owner.

### Truth 3: Software must meet a need
- If there is no need, you can build anything.
- Understanding the business problem is key to creating the right product.
- Correct requirements understanding and agreement with the owner is crucial.

### Truth 4: Software must solve the business problem
- Building software does not necessarily solve the business problem.
- Development should start with the problem, not a perceived solution.
- Mistakes in requirements lead to high costs and failed projects.

### Truth 5: Requirements need to be communicated effectively
- Whether written or verbal, requirements must be communicated to the developers.
- Writing requirements helps in understanding and provides traceability.

### Truth 6: The customer may not always know the right answer
- Customers might not know exactly what they need, and requirements need refining.
- Stakeholders may provide incremental improvements instead of innovative solutions.

### Truth 7: Requirements development needs an orderly process
- An orderly process is essential for developing requirements, but not a rigid procedure.
- Understanding the process tasks helps in effective application.

### Truth 8: Iterative development still needs requirements
- Iterative methods do not make requirements redundant.
- The key is to discover what is needed without producing unnecessary documentation.

### Truth 9: No process can replace good thinking
- Good processes help smart people, but poor thought cannot be compensated by tools or methods.

### Truth 10: Requirements must be measurable and testable
- Functional and non-functional requirements should be precise and measurable.
- If a requirement cannot be measured, it is not a requirement.

### Truth 11: Business analysts change how users think
- The process of defining requirements helps stakeholders better understand their own needs.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Describes actions that the product must take (e.g., calculations, reports).

### Non-functional Requirements
- Qualities or properties the product must have (e.g., performance, usability).

### Constraints
- Constraints are global requirements that limit the project scope or design (e.g., deadlines, platform requirements).

## Volere Requirements Process
- The Volere Process helps in discovering, verifying, and documenting requirements.
- It focuses on deliverables rather than rigid procedures, providing flexibility for different project needs.
